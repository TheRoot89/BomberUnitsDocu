<h2>About ... us! </h2>
<p>Our goals are</p>
<ul>
<li>Having fun!</li>
<li>Learning how to make games</li>
<li>Discovering the different aspects that need to be taken care of</li>
<li>Realizing game ideas we would want to play ourselves</li>
<li>Becoming better coders, designers, architects ...</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the game </h2>
<p>So, <b>Bomberman</b> is a classic game type (Google!). We first want to replicate its classic, simple scheme of moving your player figure, lay bombs, collect PowerUps and finally explode your opponents.</p>
<p>As this is vitally important today, we also want to support <b>mixed multiplayer</b> (local, online). Of course a game does not just start directly with a level and your fellow players already there. There will have to be a menu UI, (online) player management, level selection, game-over screen etc...</p>
<p>When this runs stable, we want to add our own take on the genre and add our <b>own features</b>. This even more so than the above points is a group effort, where we can brainstorm, decide, implement and test together.</p>
<p>Interested? Read the <b><a class="el" href="page_getting_started.html">Getting Started</a></b> page so set things up. For more details on what there is to do, read on :)</p>
<h2>So how can I contribute? </h2>
<p>The are quite a lot of things to be done, where you can pick what you think is most fun for you. A brainstormed list, with the must-haves in <b>bold</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Game Design</b></li>
<li><b>Planning &amp; Teamwork</b></li>
<li><b>Art Design &amp; Modelling</b></li>
<li>Rigging &amp; Animation</li>
<li>Level Design</li>
<li><b>Scripting</b></li>
<li><b>Effects</b></li>
<li>Post processing</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li><b>Testing</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Okay, what does the above mean, roughly, and how would I go on about it? </h2>
<h3>Game Design</h3>
<p>The core of any project: figuring out what the f*** we actually want. In order to get going, we need at least some basic ideas, preferably with an interesting twist. Then we need to refine these ideas to answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will playing this be fun?</li>
<li>What are the core elements and themes?</li>
<li>What shall the Player's experience be like?</li>
<li>What should the graphical style be like? What that of the UI?</li>
<li>What main functionality will the SW have to provide?</li>
<li>What other, crazy ideas do we have? Do they fit in?</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>tools to support this</b> are up to discussion - I just started with plain Powerpoint.</p>
<h3>Planning &amp; Teamwork</h3>
<p>So, imagine we have quite a big list of tasks, big and small, crazy ideas and stuff we just want to try to see whether they work. We need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Decide what has to be done in which order from a technical perspective.</li>
<li>What we want to do first of the things that require no special order. What are the ratios of gain vs. effort for the features we want to add?</li>
<li>Who wants to do what? Is everyone happy with what he is doing and where we are going? Does anyone need help?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, stuff needs to be taken care of:</p>
<ul>
<li>When and how do we meet?</li>
<li>How do we want to collaborate? Are there any rules?</li>
<li>Most importantly: How can we improve?</li>
</ul>
<p>One <b>tool to support this</b> is surely the project tab and issue tracking of <a href="https://github.com/TheRoot89/BomberUnits">GitHub</a>, where our code is hosted anyway. It offers a way to collect, sort and prioritize ideas as notes, track tasks, and rant about them in strong language. Information not related to ideas or tasks may be tracked using these nice Markdown pages.</p>
<h3>Art Design &amp; Modelling</h3>
<p>If this is not a text adventure, we will need to show some art, be it 2D or 3D. How can we achieve this without hiring Weta Workshop? How do we achieve a reasonable look with comparably low effort?</p>
<p>The <b>tools to support this</b> are manyfold, with many specialized solutions for the different artsy tasks, depending on what we want. Simple models can be made for example with <a href="https://assetforge.io/">AssetForge</a>, while arbitrarily complex stuff can be done with Blender. Maps and textures can be found, also free, all over the web. The final look will also largely depend on the Postprocessing Stack, allowing cool looks for low-poly models.</p>
<h3>Rigging &amp; Animation</h3>
<p>Rigging is the task of providing a virtual skeleton, or <em>rig</em>, for your models. This allows to deform the models to assume natural looking poses. A sequence of such poses forms an Animation, which is a kind of asset importable and replay-able in Unity.</p>
<p><b>Tools to support this:</b> Rigging is typically supported by modeling SW, such as Blender. Animations may be done in the Unity editor as well, while the final chaining of animations with animation state machines is a task of game development, also supported graphically by the Unity Editor.</p>
<h3>Level Design</h3>
<p>This is what the title implies, and you have probably seen good and bad levels abound yourselves. It is a bit of a cross-over task:<br />
 The design aspect of this is a part of the <em>Game Design</em>, especially when thinking of cool level features, which will need support from a <em>Scripting</em> perspective.</p>
<p>For the actual modeling of a level Scene, using mainly the Unity Editor as <b>Tool</b>, you will combine Models as well as maybe create your own stuff, as a <em>Modeling</em> guy would do. Poor fella.</p>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>This is the art of learning what the Unity API has to offer, how to use that to design an understandable and reusable SW architecture and - of course - coding the thing in C# (or Java Script alternatively). The scripts bring the game objects to life, let you play with friends, produce tons of log output, and so on...<br />
 Game development may sound like it is all about Coding/Scripting, but as you see, there are many daunting tasks each worthy ofa whole profession in the industry.</p>
<p>The <b>tools to do that</b> are Unity and a supported IDE, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Have a look at the Tooling section (<a class="el" href="page_tooling.html">Tooling</a>) for how to set those up. There is no black magic involved, as Unity pretty much has the whole toolchain, up to deployment, built-in. Nice.</p>
<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>This category wraps up some of the typical features found in Game Engines: particle systems, sound effects and the relevant scripting making effects <em>affecting</em> the game world. This is also a bit of a crossover task, and you get to play with explosions. Also in the effects category are screen effects, supported by the rendering pipeline used, which is quite the topic of its own.</p>
<p>The Unity editor may be all the <b>tool</b> you need to get started. Also Unity gives away quite a lot of free-to-use effects we can start with. Building on that, you may need to roam the Net and use some tools of the other disciplines to create you very own uber-effects!</p>
<h3>Post processing</h3>
<p>In Post processing, meaning after the basic rendering of the frame, it is possible to apply further transformations to apply effect or improve style and image quality. Typical tasks are Anti-Aliasing or the Bloom effect. This has to be designed, tuned and tested. From the <b>tooling</b> perspective, all this should be supported by Unity itself I think - but I am by no means experienced in that area.</p>
<h3>DevOps</h3>
<p>If we decide to have, e.g. build automation, common tool configurations (such as for Doxygen in the doc folder), etc. - someone will have to look after that. Someone willing to be the all-important enabler of the whole team. That someone could be you!</p>
<p>The skills learned/needed here are probably no special to game development, and the <b>tools</b> are manyfold, depending on what the team deems worthy automating.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>No time for the other stuff? No worries - we need people that from time to time have a look at the current state and tell us what we f**** up. At pat on the back is also helpful sometimes.</p>
<p>And then, there is <em>proper</em> testing, including <em>Unit Tests</em>. It may not seem reasonable for the dynamic nature of game scripting code, but it is very well possible and supported by Unity's own set own <b>tools</b>. The scripters will kiss the feet of the guy who tells them how to use those tools. At the very latest when complexity increases and devs become afraid of breaking things accidentally.</p>
<h2>Where to learn more? </h2>
<p>On this subpage you can get up to speed: **<a class="el" href="page_getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>**</p>
<p>Luckily, there is an abundance of resources on Unity (and probably on the other stuff as well) on the web. You may start with the tutorials present on the Unity website. Or you can take courses on leaning portals, such as Zenva or Udemy. The best way to learn of course is to take part in this project and learn from and with your friends. Most importantly, don't think anyone will look down on you because you are just learning a new thing - this is not Dota after all... (yet).</p>
