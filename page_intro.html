<h2>About ... us! </h2>
<p>Our goals are</p>
<ul>
<li>Having fun!</li>
<li>Learning how to make games</li>
<li>Discovering the different aspects that need to be taken care of</li>
<li>Realizing game ideas we would want to play ourselves</li>
<li>Becoming better coders, designers, architects ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additions? What's your ranking among the above? :)</p>
<h2>Getting started </h2>
<p>Alright recruit, to get you up to speed we will (probably) need five things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do the necessary installations</li>
<li>Clone our repo from GitHub</li>
<li>Understand the basics of our tools</li>
<li>Have a rough picture on the state of the project</li>
<li>An example of a typical SW change workflow</li>
</ol>
<h3>1: Do the necessary installations</h3>
<p><b>The correct Unity Version via Unity Hub</b><br />
 Hop on over to <a href="https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download">Unity</a>, select the Unity Hub for download and go through the setup.<br />
 Unity Hub allows you to manage multiple installations of Unity on your computer, as well as associate your projects (and our project) with one of these installations. This is a good thing, as we need to work all with the same version but you may, for example, need want to switch back to an old branch requiring an older Unity.<br />
 Install and select the currently used Unity version from the Hub App. You can find our currently used Unity version near the top of our mainpage in the "Last stable release" note.</p>
<p><b>Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code</b><br />
 The Unity Editor comes with built-in support vor VS and VS Code. This means Unity will create the project configuration and start it up when you click to edit a script from your game's <em>Assets</em>. You need to have one of the above installed. Unity offers to install a VS version automatically with its main installation.</p>
<p>Toni strongly recommends though to check out VS Code as it is awesome. To switch to VS Code support from the default VS: Open up <em>Unity Preferences</em>, <em>External Tools</em>, then browse for the VS Code executable as <em>External Script Editor</em>. VS Code profits from a vast range of plugins to make your life easier and some especially useful for us are listed on the <em>Tooling</em> page: <a class="el" href="page_tooling.html">Tooling</a> <br />
 Also look <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity">here</a> for more info on VS Code used with Unity.</p>
<p><b>Git</b><br />
 Git is one of the currently most popular Versioning Tools out there. It can be used from the command line, but got a lot of graphical front ends from hobby devs and companies alike. Download it <a href="https://git-scm.com/">here</a> and be sure to understand the basics of it by making use of the vast amount of tutorials on the net (for example on the Git homepage itself).<br />
</p>
<p><b>Doxygen</b><br />
 ...is the defacto standard for automated documentation generation for all kinds of languages. This is not a <em>must</em>, but dearly recommended, as we try to document lots of useful stuff nicely readable there **fingers crossed**. Get it <a href="http://doxygen.nl/files/doxygen-1.8.16-setup.exe">here</a> and install. This is also a command line tool - usage instructions can be found on our project homepage mainpage.</p>
<h3>2: Clone our repo from GitHub</h3>
<p>Your Git installation gives you access to our repository on GitHub. You may want to download and install the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> client for ease of use.<br />
 If you choose to do so, you will simply have to log into the client and can already add a repository from GitHub from the "Current Repository" section at the top left -&gt; "Add" -&gt; "Clone Repository". You may have to give the direct ULR (as from the browser) of the repo as it is set to be private to us.</p>
<p>After the clone, be sure to execute<br />
 <code>git lfs install</code><br />
 from your local repo folder once, using for example the Git Bash, which comes with your Git installation. This ensures large files are not saved in every version on every client, which is important when working with Unity Assets.</p>
<p>You will now have the newest "Master" branch checked out. The folder can be selected from Unity Hub as project and should open with an installed Unity version as given on the top of the mainpage.</p>
<h3>3: Understand the basics of our tools</h3>
<p>This should be more of lookup thing than learning everything beforehand. Go to the <a class="el" href="page_tooling.html">Tooling</a> if you need info on a certain tool. Maybe start with Unity itself ;).</p>
<h3>4. Have a rough picture on the state of the project</h3>
<p>Ok, this is the most tricky part. The idea is to have everything documented on the following pages and their respective child pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>**<a class="el" href="page_concepts.html">Concepts</a>** : Overall design approaches with requirements and ideas = high level</li>
<li>**<a class="el" href="page_sys_components.html">System Components</a>** : Describes the overall parts the SW is made of, implementing the concepts = low level</li>
</ul>
<p>Best use the doxygen output for reading this, so links to classes etc. work. There is always a version of this docu together with the Doxygen output from the master branch hosted here: </p><blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><a href="https://theroot89.github.io/BomberUnitsDocu/index.html">https://theroot89.github.io/BomberUnitsDocu/index.html</a><br />
 (It may be out of date though...) </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. An example of a typical SW change workflow</h3>
<p>For a feature implementation, things may go like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We decide together which features we want to implement next and move these on our <a href="https://github.com/TheRoot89/BomberUnits/projects">GitHub Repo Projects page</a> from the "Ideas" column to the "ToDo" column.</li>
<li>Choose one of these tasks and convert the note card to a full <em>Issue</em> via "..." -&gt; "Convert to Issue", if that was not already done before. You also assign yourself as the "Assignee" of that task.</li>
<li>Fill the issue with whatever info you feel necessary or start a conversation using the comment section.</li>
<li>Create a branch (from master most of the time), mentioning the issue number in its naming.<br />
 Example: "feature/#4_implement_multiplayer".<br />
 Using the "feature/" prefix allows us to sort the branch names after features, bugfixes, releases and whatever categories we want to define.</li>
<li>Work on you branch and add the feature, using Git and pushing your changes to our repo. Best move your issue from the "ToDo" column to the "In progress" column.</li>
<li>If there were changes on the master branch from when you branched off it, merge "master" to your branch to check compatibility, resolve merge conflicts and test whether everything still works as expected.</li>
<li>Go to GitHub, select your branch on the left and click "New pull request". Fill in the details of what you did on your branch, assign Reviewers on the top right and click "Create pull request".</li>
<li>Once the reviews from us approve your changes, the created pull request (PR) can be merged in GitHub. If you don't need it any longer, your branch can be deleted (this will only delete the name, not the commits you did) and you can close your Issue and move it to the "Done" column! Yeah!</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope you feel like you know how things go now. Read on for info on Unity and what needs to be done in game development in general.</p>
<h2>On Unity </h2>
<p>Unity is a game engine and tool collection for this engine. There is no real winner when comparing Unity to other free engines, like Unreal - so we just start with the one that looks easier to pick up.</p>
<p>Unity comes with its own graphical editor to arrange your game world in what Unity calls <em>Scenes</em>. In-game you as a player will always be in one of these Scenes. It may and will feature so-called <em>GameObjects</em>, representing any kind of entity present int the Scene, e.g. a player figure, bullets, particle effects or invisible objects only there to hold <em>Scripts</em>.</p>
<p>Scripts represented the logic of a game, implemented in C#. These can be written as in any other project, defining and creating objects and calling the Unity API to act on the game world.</p>
<p>Interaction of your Scripts with the engine comes in two directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Script to engine: Your Script causes something to happen by calling the API, e.g. to change the position of a game object.</li>
<li>Engine to Script: Some predefined Script functions can be called from the game and are thus called <em>Callbacks</em>. An example is the <em>Update()</em> function called by the game for every frame.<br />
 In order for this to work your Script's class has to be a <em>Behavior</em>, by inheriting from the <em>MonoBehavior</em> class. In order for your class to be instantiated and the Callbacks (like <em>Update</em>) to be called, it also has to be added to a <em>GameObject</em> in the Unity editor. That <em>GameObject</em> will now have the additional <em>Behavior</em> you code for it.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Example: A <em>PlayerController</em> script is often added to the player's figure in the game world. Each frame its <em>Update</em> function will be called by the engine. Within that function, code may be added to check the input keys a player may be pressing to control his figure and the figure may then be moved accordingly. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>About the game </h2>
<p>So, <b>Bomberman</b> is a classic game type (Google!). We first want to replicate its classic, simple scheme of moving your player figure, lay bombs, collect PowerUps and finally explode your opponents.</p>
<p>As this is vitally important today, we also want to support <b>mixed multiplayer</b> (local, online). Of course a game does not just start directly with a level and your fellow players already there. There will have to be a menu UI, (online) player management, level selection, game-over screen etc...</p>
<p>When this runs stable, we want to add our own take on the genre and add our <b>own features</b>. This even more so than the above points is a group effort, where we can brainstorm, decide, implement and test together.</p>
<h2>So how can I contribute? </h2>
<p>The are quite a lot of things to be done, where you can pick what you think is most fun for you. A brainstormed list, with the must-haves in <b>bold</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Game Design</b></li>
<li><b>Planning &amp; Teamwork</b></li>
<li><b>Art Design &amp; Modelling</b></li>
<li>Rigging &amp; Animation</li>
<li>Level Design</li>
<li><b>Scripting</b></li>
<li><b>Effects</b></li>
<li>Post processing</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li><b>Testing</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Okay, what does the above mean, roughly, and how would I go on about it? </h2>
<h3>Game Design</h3>
<p>The core of any project: figuring out what the f*** we actually want. In order to get going, we need at least some basic ideas, preferably with an interesting twist. Then we need to refine these ideas to answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will playing this be fun?</li>
<li>What are the core elements and themes?</li>
<li>What shall the Player's experience be like?</li>
<li>What should the graphical style be like? What that of the UI?</li>
<li>What main functionality will the SW have to provide?</li>
<li>What other, crazy ideas do we have? Do they fit in?</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>tools to support this</b> are up to discussion - I just started with plain Powerpoint.</p>
<h3>Planning &amp; Teamwork</h3>
<p>So, imagine we have quite a big list of tasks, big and small, crazy ideas and stuff we just want to try to see whether they work. We need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Decide what has to be done in which order from a technical perspective.</li>
<li>What we want to do first of the things that require no special order. What are the ratios of gain vs. effort for the features we want to add?</li>
<li>Who wants to do what? Is everyone happy with what he is doing and where we are going? Does anyone need help?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, stuff needs to be taken care of:</p>
<ul>
<li>When and how do we meet?</li>
<li>How do we want to collaborate? Are there any rules?</li>
<li>Most importantly: How can we improve?</li>
</ul>
<p>One <b>tool to support this</b> is surely the project tab and issue tracking of <a href="https://github.com/TheRoot89/BomberUnits">GitHub</a>, where our code is hosted anyway. It offers a way to collect, sort and prioritize ideas as notes, track tasks, and rant about them in strong language. Information not related to ideas or tasks may be tracked using these nice Markdown pages.</p>
<h3>Art Design &amp; Modelling</h3>
<p>If this is not a text adventure, we will need to show some art, be it 2D or 3D. How can we achieve this without hiring Weta Workshop? How do we achieve a reasonable look with comparably low effort?</p>
<p>The <b>tools to support this</b> are manyfold, with many specialized solutions for the different artsy tasks, depending on what we want. Simple models can be made for example with <a href="https://assetforge.io/">AssetForge</a>, while arbitrarily complex stuff can be done with Blender. Maps and textures can be found, also free, all over the web. The final look will also largely depend on the Postprocessing Stack, allowing cool looks for low-poly models.</p>
<h3>Rigging &amp; Animation</h3>
<p>Rigging is the task of providing a virtual skeleton, or <em>rig</em>, for your models. This allows to deform the models to assume natural looking poses. A sequence of such poses forms an Animation, which is a kind of asset importable and replay-able in Unity.</p>
<p><b>Tools to support this:</b> Rigging is typically supported by modeling SW, such as Blender. Animations may be done in the Unity editor as well, while the final chaining of animations with animation state machines is a task of game development, also supported graphically by the Unity Editor.</p>
<h3>Level Design</h3>
<p>This is what the title implies, and you have probably seen good and bad levels abound yourselves. It is a bit of a cross-over task:<br />
 The design aspect of this is a part of the <em>Game Design</em>, especially when thinking of cool level features, which will need support from a <em>Scripting</em> perspective.</p>
<p>For the actual modeling of a level Scene, using mainly the Unity Editor as <b>Tool</b>, you will combine Models as well as maybe create your own stuff, as a <em>Modeling</em> guy would do. Poor fella.</p>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
<p>This is the art of learning what the Unity API has to offer, how to use that to design an understandable and reusable SW architecture and - of course - coding the thing in C# (or Java Script alternatively). The scripts bring the game objects to life, let you play with friends, produce tons of log output, and so on...<br />
 Game development may sound like it is all about Coding/Scripting, but as you see, there are many daunting tasks each worthy ofa whole profession in the industry.</p>
<p>The <b>tools to do that</b> are Unity and a supported IDE, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. Have a look at the Tooling section (<a class="el" href="page_tooling.html">Tooling</a>) for how to set those up. There is no black magic involved, as Unity pretty much has the whole toolchain, up to deployment, built-in. Nice.</p>
<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>This category wraps up some of the typical features found in Game Engines: particle systems, sound effects and the relevant scripting making effects <em>affecting</em> the game world. This is also a bit of a crossover task, and you get to play with explosions. Also in the effects category are screen effects, supported by the rendering pipeline used, which is quite the topic of its own.</p>
<p>The Unity editor may be all the <b>tool</b> you need to get started. Also Unity gives away quite a lot of free-to-use effects we can start with. Building on that, you may need to roam the Net and use some tools of the other disciplines to create you very own uber-effects!</p>
<h3>Post processing</h3>
<p>In Post processing, meaning after the basic rendering of the frame, it is possible to apply further transformations to apply effect or improve style and image quality. Typical tasks are Anti-Aliasing or the Bloom effect. This has to be designed, tuned and tested. From the <b>tooling</b> perspective, all this should be supported by Unity itself I think - but I am by no means experienced in that area.</p>
<h3>DevOps</h3>
<p>If we decide to have, e.g. build automation, common tool configurations (such as for Doxygen in the doc folder), etc. - someone will have to look after that. Someone willing to be the all-important enabler of the whole team. That someone could be you!</p>
<p>The skills learned/needed here are probably no special to game development, and the <b>tools</b> are manyfold, depending on what the team deems worthy automating.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>No time for the other stuff? No worries - we need people that from time to time have a look at the current state and tell us what we f**** up. At pat on the back is also helpful sometimes.</p>
<p>And then, there is <em>proper</em> testing, including <em>Unit Tests</em>. It may not seem reasonable for the dynamic nature of game scripting code, but it is very well possible and supported by Unity's own set own <b>tools</b>. The scripters will kiss the feet of the guy who tells them how to use those tools. At the very latest when complexity increases and devs become afraid of breaking things accidentally.</p>
<h2>Where to learn more? </h2>
<p>Luckily, there is an abundance of resources on Unity (and probably on the other stuff as well) on the web. You may start with the tutorials present on the Unity website. Or you can take courses on leaning portals, such as Zenva or Udemy. The best way to learn of course is to take part in this project and learn from and with your friends. Most importantly, don't think anyone will look down on you because you are just learning a new thing - this is not Dota after all... (yet).</p>
